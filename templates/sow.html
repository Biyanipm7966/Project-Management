            As the Python Developer for the Project Management Dashboard project, I was responsible for designing, coding, 
            and implementing the entire website backend using Python, ensuring seamless integration with frontend elements. 
            I developed core functionalities, including a dynamic dashboard displaying project information, a calendar for 
            scheduling and timeline visualization, interactive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) diagrams, and an Activity-on-
            Arrow (AOA) diagram for effective project planning. Using frameworks like Flask or Django, I created modular, 
            reusable, and well-documented code, enabling scalability and ease of maintenance. I collaborated closely with 
            the team to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface while 
            conducting extensive testing to resolve bugs and optimize performance. My work involved preparing comprehensive 
            documentation, providing updates to the project manager, and delivering a fully functional, intuitive, and 
            feature-rich dashboard that enhanced project tracking and decision-making.

            For the Punch project I had the role of researcher, and my assignments were to assist in the drafting of some of 
            the first documents for the project. I assisted in drafting the project charter and evaluating some of the initial 
            risks during the beginning of the project. I was also tasked with creating the final System of Work, this is what I 
            spent most of my time working on, this is also where most of the complications arose. Tracking down all the documentation 
            that went into the SoW was the most complex part of this task. Throughout the project my task was to create documentation 
            for the final SoW and to assist with other tasks when needed/asked.
